**When you download a project, please run 'pod install' in terminal to ensure that the project runs smoothly.**

I am maintaining a local sqlite database as you requested. The credentials that we had already created on local machines couldn't be shared.

Please set up fresh login credentials on your end. We have 2 cases here.

Case 1 :- if it is new user
===========================

If you enter valid email and password and country. If it is new user, it will save into local sqlite database and navigate to home screen automatically.

Case 2 :- if it is existing user 
================================

If the user is already registered on the local sqlite database, you must enter a working password for that email address, otherwise the app will throw an error.

Third Party SDK Details ================
1. Lottie - To use animation in project , I have used to show loader while tap on Login
2. Almofire
